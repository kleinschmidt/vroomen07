\description{
Subjects were tested on forced choice b/d classification throughout
recalibration/selective adaptation, after 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and
256 cumulative exposures.  Adaptors were audiovisual stimuli, with visual /b/
or /d/ and audio from a 1-9 /b/-to-/d/ continuum.  Test stimuli were taken
from the middle of the continuum, based on the pre-test classification (most
ambiguous plus/minus one).
